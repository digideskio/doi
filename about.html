EU Integrity Watch is a user-friendly database that provides a unique
overview of the activities of members of the European Parliament
(MEPs) and enables a range of rankings and visual comparisons. It
also allows to better monitor potential conflicts of interests or to
identify those MEPs with a high degree of external activity.</p>
<p >EU Integrity
Watch was launched in October 2014 by the Transparency International
EU Office (TI-EU). The project is co-funded by the Open Society
Initiative for Europe (OSIFE).</p>

<p ><b>Background on
lobbying and conflicts of interest</b></p>
<p ><font face="Calibri, serif">Over
recent years, public policy debates have been giving increasing
attention to the importance of safeguarding the integrity of
parliamentarians and their activities.&nbsp; As the scope of
interaction between public and private sectors increases, for example
through the greater privatisation of public services, the systematic
use of external expertise to feed into law-making, and individuals
moving in and out of each sector over the course of their careers,
ethics regimes in public institutions need to be sufficient to deal
with heightened integrity and corruption risks.&nbsp; As the OECD
noted in their <a href="http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/48994419.pdf">2005
Guidelines for Managing Conflict of Interest in the Public Service</a><font face="Calibri, serif">,
without adequate <font face="Calibri, serif"><i>identification
and management</i><font face="Calibri, serif"> of potential
conflicts of interest, the opportunities for public figures to abuse
their positions for personal gain increase.&nbsp; Protections
therefore need to be in place to ensure that legislators serve the
public interest and not narrow, vested interests.</p>
<p ><br>
</p>
<p ><font face="Calibri, serif">The
situation in Europe is mixed.&nbsp; In our 2012 report &lsquo;<a href="http://www.transparency.org/enis/report">Money,
Politics, Power: Corruption Risks in Europe</a><font face="Calibri, serif">&rsquo;,
Transparency International looked at the anti-corruption safeguards
in 25 European countries.&nbsp; Our research found that while only a
small number of these countries had codes of conduct in place for
parliamentarians, the majority do require legislators to declare
their interests, assets and outside income.&nbsp; However, problems
were noticed in the verification mechanisms in many countries,
affecting public confidence in the veracity of declarations.</p>
<p ><br>
</p>
<p ><font face="Calibri, serif">In
its <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/documents/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/docs/acr_2014_en.pdf">2014
EU Anti-Corruption Report</a><font face="Calibri, serif">,
the European Commission identified similar concerns, highlighting the
lack of checks on financial declarations of national MPs as a major
weakness in the integrity systems of many EU countries. Verifications
on the substance of declarations of interests were found often to be
&lsquo;formalistic and mostly limited to administrative checks&rsquo;,
with the tools and capacity to carry out substantial checks deemed to
be &lsquo;insufficient&rsquo;.</p>
<p ><br>
</p>
<p ><b>Background on the
European Parliament&rsquo;s Code of Conduct</b></p>
<p >As a reaction to the
cash-for-amendments scandal that hit the European Parliament in 2011
(in which four members accepted payments from undercover journalists
posing as lobbyists in exchange for the introduction of legislative
amendments) a new <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/meps/201206_Code_of_conduct_EN.pdf">code
of conduct</a> was introduced in 2012.</p>
<p ><br>
</p>
<p >The Code obliges
Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to submit information on
their financial interests, to declare their attendance at third party
events and to reveal any gifts that they have received.</p>
<p ><br>
</p>
<p >On paper the 2012
Code of Conduct meant significant progress and the reporting
obligations were quite extensive at the time. Unfortunately the
implementation proved less ambitious. Despite recommendations by the
Advisory Committee to the President of the European Parliament
finding that seven MEPs had violated the Code of Conduct, not a
single one has been sanctioned to date.</p>
<p ><br>
</p>
<p >National Parliaments
across Europe &ndash; Germany, France and the United Kingdom in
particular &ndash; have significantly
tightened their rules and reporting obligations during the last two
years (link to Blog post that is still to be published).
Often these steps came in direct responses to scandals. In
comparison, the European Parliament is now falling behind standards
at national level, and this in a moment when euro-scepticism and
public perception of the EU institutions as corrupt are at an
all-time high.</p>
<p ><br>
</p>
<p >In this context
Transparency International has published a comprehensive review of
the integrity of 10 EU Institutions, including the European
Parliament, Commission Council and the European Court of Justice
(<a href="http://www.transparencyinternational.eu/focus_areas/eu-integrity-study/">EUIS
report</a>). Transparency International is using the
findings to advocate change inside the institutions and has
recommended a reform of the Code of Conduct of the European
Parliament that would establish an independent ethics committee to
monitor potential conflicts of interest.</p>
<p ><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%; page-break-after: avoid">
<b>Background on the EU Integrity Watch project </b></p>
<p >Following the
elections to the European Parliament in May, the new Parliament took
office on the 1st of July 2014. All members &ndash; new and old &ndash;
had until the 3rd of July to submit their declarations of financial
interest, thereby submitting their information on outside revenues,
board memberships and financial holdings.</p>
<p ><br>
</p>
<p >Transparency
International has analysed all 751 declarations and provides the
obtained information on <a href="http://www.integritywatch.eu">integritywatch.eu</a>
</p>
<p ><br>
</p>
<p >This user-friendly
database provides a unique overview of the activities of the newly
elected European Parliament and enables a range of rankings and
visual comparisons. It also allows to better monitor potential
conflicts of interest or to identify those MEPs with a high degree of
external activity.</p>
<p ><br>
</p>
<p >For that purpose
Transparency International has developed an &ldquo;External Activity
Indicator (EAI)&rdquo; (Methodology),
which scores each MEP based on the number of outside occupations,
board memberships or other political mandates as well as the
cumulative income derived from these activities.</p>
<p ><br>
</p>
<p ><b>Transparency
International policy recommendations</b></p>
<p >One conclusion
that can already be drawn from the EU Integrity Watch database is
that the declarations of financial interest and thus the Code of
Conduct of the European Parliament need reform. Meaningful monitoring
of conflicts of interest is impossible when MEPs declare that their
side-job is &ldquo;consultant&rdquo;, &ldquo;freelancer&rdquo;,
&ldquo;manager&rdquo; or something that goes under an abbreviation
such as &ldquo;RvC FMO&rdquo; or &ldquo;ASDCAM&rdquo;. The financial
thresholds in the declarations need to be revised and should allow
much more accurate reporting instead of capping the information at
&ldquo;more than 10,000 EUR&rdquo;. Better guidelines on how to fill
out the declarations are needed and the European Parliament should
better monitor the submitted declarations. An independent ethics
committee should monitor compliance and publish recommendations in
case of an alleged breach.</p>
<p >To further
improve public monitoring of potential conflicts of interest at the
Parliament and at the Commission, TI-EU suggests the adoption of a
&lsquo;legislative footprint&rsquo; mechanism &ndash; a record of all
meetings between lobbyists and lawmakers. 181 MEPs have already
committed to using this as part of TI-EU&rsquo;s anti-corruption
<a href="http://www.transparencyinternational.eu/2014/10/european-parliament-elections-2014-the-anti-corruption-pledge/">election
pledge</a>.</p>
<p >Finally, TI-EU
continues to advocate for a mandatory Transparency Register of
Lobbyists that covers the European Parliament, the Commission and the
Council, something that Commission President elect Jean-Claude
Juncker has announced for his term.</p>
<p ><b>Core
recommendations:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><p >Translate all
  declarations into all official languages</p>
  <li><p >Revise the
  financial thresholds in the declaration to allow more accurate
  reporting and monitoring of outside revenue</p>
  <li><p >Publish more
  detailed information in the declarations to allow a meaningful
  monitoring of potential conflicts of interest</p>
  <li><p >Standardise as
  much of the information as possible to allow better comparisons and
  groupings and to connect the information with other databases, such
  as the Transparency Register</p>
  <li><p >Publish all
  declarations of interest in a centralised, searchable manner,
  including historical declarations (.xml files instead of .pdf)</p>
  <li><p >The European
  Parliament administration should better check the declarations for
  plausibility and possible errors &ndash; false declarations should
  lead to sanctions</p>
  <li><p >The Code of
  Conduct needs to be fully respected in word and in spirit and
  violations need to be sanctioned by the EP President</p>
