<p ><i>Methodology</i>
<p >EU Integrity Watch
was launched in October 2014 by the Transparency International EU
Office (TI-EU). The project is co-funded by the Open Society
Initiative for Europe (OSIFE).
<p ><br>

<p ><b>Where does the
data come from&#8204;</b>
<p >All data contained
in the EU Integrity Watch database comes from the website of the
European Parliament. EU Integrity Watch automatically extracts the
information from the original declarations that are published in Pdf
format on the Parliament's website and uses them to regularly
update its own database. The date of the latest update is featured on
our website. EU Integrity Watch is not responsible for the data that
is provided by the European Parliament. All information contained in
the original declaration is under the sole responsibility of the
member of the European Parliament that filled out and signed the
declaration. Given that the Parliament only provides the data in Pdf
format instead of a reliable .xml format our data might not be 100%
accurate. Please report any inaccuracies that you might spot to
<u>dfreund@transparency.org</u>

<p ><br>

<p ><b>How do Members of
the European Parliament declare their financial interests&#8204;</b>
<p >The Code of Conduct
of the European Parliament establishes that for reasons of
transparency, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) shall submit
a declaration of financial interests. Those declarations shall then
be published on Parliament's website. The declarations are the
sole responsibility of each individual member. EU Integrity Watch
merely copies the information contained in the declarations and makes
it available on its website. This means that the information is
currently only available in the language in which the member has
filled out the declaration.
<p ><br>

<p >On each profile of a
member we link to the profile on the Parliament's own website,
where the original declaration and all other information can be
accessed and verified.
<p ><br>

<p ><b>Why are all
revenues provided as a range&#8204;</b>
<p >According to the
Code of Conduct of the European Parliament all outside revenues or
financial interests shall be placed in one of the following
categories:
<ul>
  <li><p >500 -
  1,000 EUR per month
  <li><p >1,001 -
  5,000 EUR per month
  <li><p >5,001 -
  10,000 EUR per month
  <li><p >More than
  10,000 EUR per month
</ul>
<p >In case of revenues
of less than 500 EUR per month or 5,000 per year no category needs to
be indicated.
<p ><br>

<p ><b>What is the
External Activity Indicator (EAI)&#8204;</b>
<p >The External
Activity Indicator was developed by Transparency International to
provide a quick overview of all activities that fall under the remits
of the Code of Conduct and the declarations of financial interests.
In short, the higher the indicator the more activities a member has
declared and the higher the declared revenues. The website shades
MEPs according to their EAI - the higher the EAI the darker the
grey shading.
<p ><br>

<p >The External
Activity Indicator is not an assessment of an MEP's performance
or a judgement on the declared activities. It does not identify
actual conflicts of interest. It only serves to quickly and easily
identify those MEPs that have a higher number of declared activities
or a higher declared income from outside activities.
<p ><br>

<p >Transparency
International fully supports the European Parliament in its efforts
towards greater transparency. Therefore we encourage all Members of
the European Parliament to provide detailed and accurate declarations
of their activities and financial interests. Only those declarations
that provide meaningful and detailed information will allow the
public and civil society to monitor potential conflicts of interests.
<p ><br>

<p ><b>How is the
External Activity Indicator (EAI) calculated&#8204;</b>
<p >The External
Activity Indicator is calculated by an algorithm that allocates
points for each activity declared in a Member's declaration of
financial interest. If no activities are declared a member has an EAI
of 0. Points are attributed as follows:
<p ><br>

<ul>
  <li><p >1 point for
  each activity (2 points if the activity is a "regular
  remunerated activity")
  <li><p >1 points for
  each financial holding
  <li><p >1 point for
  every 500 EUR of minimum monthly outside revenue
  
  <li><p >10 points if
  revenue of "more than 10,000 EUR per month" are declared
  in at least one activity
</ul>
<p ><br>

question is not answered here&#8204;</b>
